# WeatherWatcher

Welcome to the Weather Watcher!

Getting ready to head out in the next 12 hours? Don't believe the temperature given to you by standard weather apps. Use Weather Watcher to give your location and see the minimum and maxium "feels like" temparature as well as the percent chance of rain (if any). Who cares if the daily high is 75 degrees? That daily high is going to be at the warmest part of the day (not necessarily when you'll be out) and may not be realistic when considering other weather factors like wind and humidty. Plan your outfit based on what the weather is actually going to "feel like!"

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
